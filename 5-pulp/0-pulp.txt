PuLP is an LP modeler written in Python. 

PuLP can generate MPS or LP files and call 
    GLPK, COIN-OR CLP/CBC, CPLEX, GUROBI, MOSEK, 
    XPRESS, CHOCO, MIPCL, HiGHS, SCIP/FSCIP 
    to solve linear problems.

Installation
------------
pip install pulp

https://github.com/coin-or/pulp/tree/master/examples
See the examples directory for examples.

The examples use the default solver (CBC).
